# Project Structure

## Next.js Application Structure
   - The project follows Next.js conventions with a `src` directory containing the main application code
   - Pages are located in `src/pages` following Next.js routing conventions
   - Components are organized in `src/components`
   - Features are modularized in `src/features`
   - Data-related code is in `src/data`
   - Utility functions are in `src/utils`
   - Server-side code is in `src/server`
   - Custom hooks are in `src/hooks`

## Feature Organization
   - Features are organized in a domain-driven structure under `src/features`
   - Each feature should be self-contained with its own components, hooks, and utilities

## Data Management
   - The project has some mockup prisma ORM files, but does not use a database
   - Environment variables are managed through `env.mjs` using `@t3-oss/env-nextjs`
   - API routes are located in `src/pages/api`
