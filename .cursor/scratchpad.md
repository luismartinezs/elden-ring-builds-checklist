# Mode: PLAN ðŸŽ¯
Current Task: Implement Accessibility Improvements
Understanding: Enhance application accessibility through ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, focus management, and screen reader support
Confidence: 90%

Accessibility Implementation Plan [ID-005]:

1. Component Audit [ID-005-1]
Status: [ ] Priority: High
- Review all interactive components
- Document current accessibility state
- Identify critical components needing immediate attention
- Create checklist of required improvements per component

2. ARIA Labels Implementation [ID-005-2]
Status: [ ] Priority: High
- Add aria-label to buttons without visible text
- Implement aria-describedby for form elements
- Add aria-expanded for expandable components
- Ensure proper heading hierarchy
Dependencies: Component Audit [ID-005-1]

3. Keyboard Navigation [ID-005-3]
Status: [ ] Priority: High
- Implement focus trapping for modals
- Add skip links for main content
- Ensure all interactive elements are tabbable
- Add keyboard shortcuts for common actions
Dependencies: Component Audit [ID-005-1]

4. Focus Management [ID-005-4]
Status: [ ] Priority: High
- Implement focus indicators
- Handle focus after dynamic content updates
- Manage focus in dialogs and modals
- Add focus restoration after route changes
Dependencies: Keyboard Navigation [ID-005-3]

5. Screen Reader Support [ID-005-5]
Status: [ ] Priority: High
- Add live regions for dynamic content
- Implement proper roles for components
- Add status messages for async operations
- Ensure proper announcement of state changes
Dependencies: ARIA Labels Implementation [ID-005-2]

Next Steps:
1. Begin with Component Audit [ID-005-1]
2. Start with highest traffic components first
3. Implement improvements incrementally
4. Test with screen readers after each major change

Testing Requirements:
- Test with VoiceOver on macOS
- Test with NVDA on Windows
- Verify keyboard-only navigation
- Check focus management
- Validate ARIA implementation

Success Criteria:
- All interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- Proper ARIA labels and roles implemented
- Focus management works correctly
- Screen readers can interpret all content
- Passes WCAG 2.1 AA standards

Dependencies:
- Access to screen readers for testing
- Knowledge of WCAG guidelines
- Component documentation
- User flows for testing

Progress Notes:
- Ready to begin with Component Audit
- Will need to document findings in a separate accessibility report
- Should create reusable accessibility components/hooks where possible
