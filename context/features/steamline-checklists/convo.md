In elden ring, i have done a pure spellcaster run with sorcery and meteorite staff, glinstone shard, carian slicer and rock sling. this build is easy to obtain and is known to be broken particularly early game. what is the corresponding build for pure incantations?

The pure Faith/Incantation equivalent to the Meteorite Staff and Rock Sling setup is widely considered to be the Prophet start with the Godslayer’s Seal and Black Flame, supplemented by a few key spells you can grab immediately.

Just like the sorcery run you did, this setup provides you with a cheap melee option, a reliable ranged poke, and a boss-melting heavy hitter right from the start of the game.

Here is the one-to-one pure Faith equivalent for your build:

1. The Catalyst: Godslayer’s Seal (The Meteorite Staff Equivalent)
While there isn't an early seal with an innate "S" scaling out of the box like the Meteorite Staff, the Godslayer’s Seal is the closest thing to an early-game powerhouse.

Why it works: It requires 27 Faith, boosts Godslayer Incantations (like Black Flame) by 10%, and out-scales almost every other seal in the early-to-mid game.

How to get it: It’s in Stormveil Castle behind a Stonesword Key fog wall near the Rampart Tower grace. You can easily run in and grab it without fighting the boss.

2. The Boss Melter: Black Flame (The Rock Sling Equivalent)
Rock Sling is famous for its stagger and physical damage. For incantations, your boss-killer is Black Flame.

Why it works: Black Flame deals standard fire damage but also applies a debuff that burns away a percentage of the enemy's maximum HP over 2 seconds. This means it absolutely melts early-game bosses and remains highly viable all the way to the end credits, regardless of the enemy's total health pool.

How to get it: Found in the exact same room as the Godslayer's Seal in Stormveil Castle.

3. The Melee DPS: Catch Flame (The Carian Slicer Equivalent)
If you start as the Prophet class, you have this from the moment you wake up.

Why it works: Just like Carian Slicer, Catch Flame is shockingly broken. It casts insanely fast, costs almost no FP, can be chain-cast, and can be used while running or jumping. Its DPS output at point-blank range will comfortably shred most early enemies and bosses before they can even react.

4. The Bread & Butter: Lightning Spear (The Glintstone Shard Equivalent)
You need a fast, reliable, mid-range projectile for picking off mobs or hitting fast targets.

Why it works: Lightning Spear travels much faster than fireballs, making it excellent for enemies that like to dodge. It can also be charged for extra damage.

How to get it: You can ride Torrent straight to Liurnia right at the start of the game (bypassing Stormveil entirely). South of the Artist's Shack, there is a lone patrolling Leyndell Knight. Kill him to get the Dragon Cult Prayerbook, and give it to Brother Corhyn at the Roundtable Hold to buy the spell.

The "Nuclear" Option: Rotten Breath
If you are willing to invest just slightly into Arcane (12 Arcane required), Rotten Breath is the ultimate early-game "I Win" button. You can grab the Dragon Communion Seal (which scales heavily with Arcane and Faith) and Rotten Breath within the first 30 minutes of the game. Spraying Scarlet Rot on a boss and then running away while their health completely drains is the quintessential "broken early game" strategy for Faith/Arcane builds.

Would you like the optimal, boss-free routing path to scoop up the Godslayer's Seal, Black Flame, and Lightning Spear within the first hour of a new playthrough?

You said
For the sorcery build i do not need to kill any major boss, but i see to get the items you describe i need to kill margit and the leyndell knight in liurnia which is not early game. how can i cheese these enemies easily? i want to be overpowered early without needing to overcome significant challenge. maybe i need different spells to replace black flame and lightning spear, before i can get these ones?

You make a completely fair point. The beauty of the Meteorite Staff and Rock Sling is that you just ride your horse, pick them up off the ground, and you are instantly a god. For pure Faith, beating Margit to get the Godslayer setup violates that "zero-effort" rule.

To become overpowered before ever stepping through a boss fog wall, you need to grab the true zero-effort nukes of the Faith build: The Flame of Frenzy and Rotten Breath.

Here is exactly how to cheese your way to unlimited power from the moment you step into Limgrave.

1. The True "Rock Sling" Equivalent: The Flame of Frenzy
This spell is completely free to pick up, requires zero bosses, and deals massive damage and stance-breaking stagger, making it perfect for melting Margit.

How to get it: Ride south into the Weeping Peninsula. Head up into the center landmass to the Callu Baptismal Church (south of the Ailing Village). The spell is sitting on a corpse inside.

Why it's broken: You can charge it up. A fully charged blast at point-blank range hits multiple times, shredding boss health bars and breaking their poise incredibly fast so you can get critical hits.

2. The Ultimate Cheese: Rotten Breath
This requires a tiny bit of setup, but absolutely zero combat skill. It allows you to inflict Scarlet Rot on almost any boss in the game, completely draining their health bar while you simply run away.

Step 1: Get a Bleed Weapon. Ride to the Weeping Peninsula and grab the Morning Star from the broken carriage near the bridge. You don't even need the stats to wield it properly; you just need its passive bleed buildup.

Step 2: Kill the Sleeping Dragon. Ride to Caelid and find Elder Dragon Greyoll outside Fort Faroth. She cannot fight back. Whack her tail with the Morning Star for a few minutes until the bleed procs kill her. You get 74,000 free Runes and 5 Dragon Hearts.

Step 3: Buy the Spell. Ride to the Cathedral of Dragon Communion in southern Caelid and exchange one heart for Rotten Breath (Requires 15 Faith and 12 Arcane—use your new runes to level up instantly).

How to use it: Summon your Spirit Ashes to distract Margit, walk up, and channel Rotten Breath. Once he is infected with Scarlet Rot, literally just run away. When it wears off in Phase 2, hit him with it one more time. Fight over.

3. Cheesing the Leyndell Knight (For Lightning Spear)
You actually do not need to kill Margit to reach Liurnia and get your Lightning Spear.

The Skip: Head north from the Stormhill Shack grace to the broken bridge. Drop down to the cliff path on the right side of the castle wall. Follow this path along the cliff edge, and it spits you out right into Liurnia, completely bypassing Stormveil Castle and Margit.

The Cheese: Ride to the Artist's Shack grace. The Leyndell Knight patrols the road just south of it. Sneak up behind him on foot and unleash a fully charged Flame of Frenzy directly into his back, or blast him with Rotten Breath from horseback and ride away until the rot eats him alive. He will drop the Dragon Cult Prayerbook.

With the Finger Seal (your starting Prophet catalyst), Flame of Frenzy, and Rotten Breath, you will absolutely steamroll Margit.

Would you like me to outline exactly where to find the absolute best early-game Spirit Ash summon to hold boss aggro while you cast these incantations?

You said
Yes, absolutely

To successfully pull off long casting animations like Rotten Breath, you need a Spirit Ash that excels at one thing: staying alive as long as possible to keep the boss's back turned to you.

For a true zero-effort, no-major-bosses run, there are two elite early-game options that perfectly complement your cheese strategy.

1. The Zero-Combat Tank: Spirit Jellyfish Ashes
If you want the absolute easiest, most reliable tank without swinging your weapon once, the Jellyfish is your best friend.

Why it works: It has an absurdly high health pool for the early game and naturally hovers out of melee range, shooting poison from afar. Because it keeps its distance, bosses have to chase it around the arena, giving you huge windows to channel Rotten Breath or charge up the Flame of Frenzy. Plus, the poison it inflicts stacks simultaneously with your Scarlet Rot.

How to get it: It is completely free. Ride to the Stormhill Shack site of grace (on the main path up toward Stormveil Castle). Inside the shack is a woman in a red hood named Roderika. Talk to her three or four times until she exhausts her dialogue, and she will just hand you the Spirit Jellyfish Ashes.

2. The Immortal Distraction: Skeletal Militiaman Ashes
If you are willing to fight one incredibly easy, slow-moving mini-boss, these skeletons are the ultimate aggro-holders because they literally refuse to die.

Why it works: This summons two spear-wielding skeletons. When a boss "kills" one, it collapses into a glowing pile of bones on the ground. As long as the boss doesn't accidentally hit that glowing pile with an AoE attack, the skeleton will resurrect a few seconds later with full health and instantly pull aggro again.

How to get it: Head to Summonwater Village in northeast Limgrave. You will find a Tibia Mariner—a ghostly boss just floating in a purple boat. He is incredibly slow and barely fights back. Just ride Torrent around him and blast him with the Flame of Frenzy. He melts in seconds and drops the ashes.

The Strategy Integration:
Walk through the boss fog, instantly summon the Jellyfish or the Skeletons, and run to the opposite side of the arena. Wait for the boss to attack your summon, walk up behind them, and unleash Rotten Breath. Once the rot takes hold, you just focus on dodging while your summon takes the beating and the boss's health bar vanishes.

Would you like me to point you toward the Faith-Knot Crystal Tear—a free flask upgrade sitting in the open world that temporarily boosts your Faith by +10 for even more early-game spell damage?

You said
I know where the faith-knot crystal tear is. tell me what bleed weapon i should use as prophet to kill greyoll..and then list all the items i need for the build in the same order i should collect them

The best bleed weapon for a starting Prophet is indeed the Morning Star, but there is a slight catch you need to know about your starting stats to use it.

The Prophet starts with 11 Strength, but the Morning Star requires 12 Strength. To wield it without the attacks bouncing off Greyoll, you simply need to two-hand the weapon. Two-handing multiplies your effective Strength by 1.5 (giving you 16 Strength), allowing you to proc the bleed effect perfectly without spending a single Rune on leveling up first.

Here is your optimized, step-by-step shopping list to become an overpowered Faith caster right out of the gate, flowing logically across the map:

Phase 1: The Limgrave Setup
Torrent & The Whetstone Knife: Rest at the Gatefront Ruins grace to get your horse. Grab the Whetstone Knife from the cellar in the ruins while you are there.

Spirit Calling Bell: Fast travel back to the Church of Elleh at night to meet Ranni and get the bell so you can use summons.

Spirit Jellyfish Ashes: Ride north to the Stormhill Shack grace and exhaust Roderika's dialogue to get your tanky summon.

Phase 2: The Weeping Peninsula Run
The Morning Star: Ride south across the Bridge of Sacrifice. Hug the main road until you see a broken carriage guarded by a few dogs and a troll. The weapon is in the chest on the back of the carriage.

The Flame of Frenzy: Continue south, wrap up around the cliffs to the Ailing Village, and drop down into the Callu Baptismal Church to grab your "Rock Sling" equivalent off the corpse.

Phase 3: The Caelid Heist
Elder Dragon Greyoll: Ride east from Limgrave into Caelid, making your way to the Fort Faroth site of grace. Walk up to the giant sleeping dragon's tail, two-hand your Morning Star, and swing away until the bleed procs kill her. You will get 74,000 Runes and 5 Dragon Hearts.

Level Up: Immediately spend your new Runes. You need at least 15 Faith and 12 Arcane for the next step. Dump the rest into Vigor so you don't get one-shot.

Rotten Breath: Ride south in Caelid to the Cathedral of Dragon Communion. Interact with the altar and trade one Dragon Heart for your ultimate boss-melting nuke.

Phase 4: The Liurnia Skip
Stormveil Cliff Path Skip: Fast travel back to Stormhill Shack. Ride north under the bridge and take the hidden cliffside path to completely bypass Stormveil Castle and enter Liurnia.

Dragon Cult Prayerbook: Ride north through Liurnia to the Artist's Shack grace. Sneak up on the patrolling Leyndell Knight just south of it and completely melt him with a Rotten Breath drive-by. Grab the book he drops.

Lightning Spear: Fast travel to the Roundtable Hold. Give the prayerbook to Brother Corhyn and buy Lightning Spear (your "Glintstone Shard" equivalent).

Phase 5: Claiming the Crown
Melt Margit: Fast travel back to the Castleward Tunnel. Summon your Jellyfish, rot Margit with Rotten Breath, and watch him die.

Godslayer's Seal & Black Flame: Proceed into Stormveil Castle to the Rampart Tower grace. Drop down outside into the courtyard with the heavily armed exiles, find the Stonesword Key fog wall, and unlock it to grab your best-in-class early seal and your main mid-to-late game boss-killer.

Would you like to know where to easily grab the Stonesword Key you'll need to unlock the Godslayer's Seal room in Stormveil?

You said
What about melee weapon? what melee weapons fit this build that can be acquired immediately?

Even as a pure spellcaster, having a melee weapon to clear out weak mobs without wasting your FP is essential. Since you are building a pure Faith character and want to stay true to the "zero bosses, immediately overpowered" rule, you have three phenomenal options that slot perfectly into the route we just built.

Here are the best immediate melee options for a pure Faith build:

1. The Heavy Hitter: Winged Scythe
This is widely considered the best early-game Faith weapon, and you can grab it right after you pick up the Flame of Frenzy.

Why it works: It has innate Faith scaling and deals both Physical and Holy damage. The weapon art, Angel's Wings, is a massive leaping slash that staggers enemies, does huge damage, and prevents human-type enemies (like NPC invaders) from healing.

The Stats: It requires 16 Strength, 16 Dexterity, and 24 Faith. While this seems high for a starting Prophet, the 74,000 Runes you get from killing Greyoll in Phase 3 of your route will easily pay for these stats.

How to get it: Head to the Tombsward Ruins in the center of the Weeping Peninsula. Go down the stairs into the dark cellar, kill or run past the two small rats, and open the chest at the back. Completely free.

2. The Pure Faith Brawler: Cipher Pata
If you do not want to invest any points into Strength or Dexterity and want to dump everything purely into Faith, this is your weapon.

Why it works: These are fist blades made of pure holy light. They weigh absolutely nothing (0.0 weight), scale exclusively with Faith, and ignore shields entirely. The weapon art, Unblockable Blade, is a brutal forward lunge that pieces right through guarding enemies.

The Stats: It requires 30 Faith. Again, your Greyoll runes will get you very close to this, and your Faith-Knot Crystal Tear can temporarily bridge the gap.

How to get it: Once Melina takes you to the Roundtable Hold, jump off the central balcony into the large room below. Immediately run through the doorway to the left (ignoring Mad Tongue Alberich as he spawns). Follow the rooms to the left until you find it on a bed.

3. The Custom Converter: Sacred Blade Ash of War
If you want to just keep using your Morning Star (or any basic weapon like a Broadsword) but want it to hit like a truck using your Faith stat, you need this Ash of War.

Why it works: Applying this to a normal weapon gives it the "Sacred" affinity, meaning it will now scale primarily with your Faith stat and deal Holy damage. Using the weapon art fires a golden projectile and buffs the weapon with even more Holy damage for 40 seconds.

The Stats: Fits whatever basic weapon you put it on.

How to get it: Ride to the Third Church of Marika in eastern Limgrave. Just north of the church, there is a small glowing Teardrop Scarab rolling around in the water. Kill it before it disappears, and it drops the Sacred Blade Ash of War.

Would you like me to outline where to find the Radagon Icon talisman to significantly speed up the casting time for all your new incantations?

You said
Is there a weapon with a cool ash of war equivalent to the carian knight sword.

If you want a weapon art that matches the visual flair and raw magical feel of the Carian Knight’s Sword, but scaled for a Faith build, you need Ashes of War that deal heavy elemental damage and have spectacular animations.

While the true 1:1 "giant glowing sword" equivalent is the Coded Sword (which features a massive, unblockable holy slash), it is locked away in Leyndell, the Royal Capital, making it strictly a mid-game weapon.

To stay true to your early-game, zero-bosses rule, here are the most spectacular Faith-based Ashes of War you can grab immediately to turn any basic weapon into a flashy powerhouse.

1. The Holy Destructo Disc: Ash of War: Sacred Ring of Light
This is arguably the coolest early-game Faith attack. Instead of a giant sword, your weapon becomes a projectile launcher that fires a spinning, golden halo of pure holy energy.

Why it’s cool: It functions exactly like a Destructo Disc. It has excellent range, costs very little FP, and can be chain-cast rapidly to shred enemies from a safe distance.

Weapon Pairing: It can be applied to polearms, spears, and scythes. Grabbing the standard Halberd (bought from the Nomadic Merchant in North Limgrave) or the Lucerne (found in Liurnia) and applying this Ash turns it into a high-tier weapon.

How to get it: Ride to the heart of the Swamp of Aeonia in Caelid. Tucked slightly south of the Commander O'Neil boss arena, there is a Teardrop Scarab rolling around in the rot. Snipe it with your Lightning Spear or Catch Flame to get the Ash. Zero bosses required.

2. The Pyromancer’s Sweep: Ash of War: Flaming Strike
If you prefer fire over holy light, this is the most stylish offensive Ash of War you can get without fighting a boss.

Why it’s cool: Pressing the weapon art casts a wide, blinding arc of flames in front of you. If you immediately follow up with a heavy attack, your character lunges forward through the fire, executing a devastating horizontal cleave that coats your weapon in permanent flames for the next 40 seconds. It is incredibly satisfying to pull off.

Weapon Pairing: You can slap this on almost any standard sword, including your Broadsword or a Lordsworn's Straight Sword.

How to get it: Ride to Redmane Castle in southern Caelid. Do not go inside; instead, ride Torrent up the cliff path wrapping around the right side of the castle walls. You will reach a small graveyard filled with bats. Ignore the bats, kill the Teardrop Scarab in the graveyard, and the Ash is yours.

3. The Flashy Drop: The Halo Scythe
If you are willing to spend 15 to 20 minutes farming instead of just picking an item off the ground, this scythe comes with a unique, upgraded version of the Sacred Ring of Light called Miquella's Ring of Light.

Why it’s cool: The weapon itself looks incredible, and the casting animation for the halos is smoother and more fluid than the standard Ash of War version. It also has innate bleed buildup, giving you dual damage types.

How to get it: You have to kill the Cleanrot Knights patrolling the Swamp of Aeonia in Caelid until one drops it. Since you already have the Flame of Frenzy and Rotten Breath, you can easily stunlock and melt them from horseback without much danger.

Would you like the exact map route to grab the Sacred Scorpion Charm, a talisman sitting completely unguarded in the world that will boost the damage of your holy weapon arts by 12%?

You said
Got it, provide entire checklist to collect in order again

Here is your master checklist to assemble the complete, overpowered early-game pure Faith build. This route requires absolutely zero major boss fights until you are fully armed and ready to melt Margit to finish the collection.

Choose the Prophet class to start with Catch Flame and the Finger Seal, then follow this path:

Phase 1: Limgrave Essentials
Torrent & Whetstone Knife: Rest at the Gatefront Ruins to get your horse from Melina. Go down into the ruin's cellar to grab the Whetstone Knife (needed to apply Ashes of War).

Sacred Blade Ash of War: Ride east to the Third Church of Marika. Grab the Flask of Wondrous Physick inside, then kill the glowing Teardrop Scarab just north of the church in the water for this Ash.

Spirit Calling Bell: Fast travel back to the Church of Elleh at night. Speak to Renna (Ranni) to get the bell and the Lone Wolf Ashes.

Spirit Jellyfish Ashes: Ride north toward Stormveil Castle and rest at the Stormhill Shack. Exhaust Roderika’s dialogue until she hands you your ultimate early-game tank summon.

Phase 2: The Weeping Peninsula (Melee & Stagger)
Morning Star: Ride south into the Weeping Peninsula. Loot the chest on the back of the broken carriage guarded by a troll and dogs to get your bleed weapon.

Winged Scythe: Continue south to the Tombsward Ruins. Go down the stairs into the dark cellar and open the chest for your premium Faith melee weapon.

The Flame of Frenzy: Ride east up the cliffs to the Ailing Village, then drop down into the Callu Baptismal Church to pick up your primary stagger incantation from the corpse inside.

Phase 3: The Caelid Heist (Runes, Rot, & Fire)
Elder Dragon Greyoll: Ride east from Limgrave to Fort Faroth in Caelid. Two-hand your Morning Star and attack her tail until the bleed procs kill her. Enjoy your 74,000 Runes and 5 Dragon Hearts.

Level Up: Spend your runes immediately. Hit 15 Faith and 12 Arcane for Rotten Breath. If you want to use the Winged Scythe, hit 16 Strength and 16 Dexterity. Put the rest into Vigor.

Flaming Strike Ash of War (Optional): Ride down to Redmane Castle in southern Caelid. Bypass the castle by taking the cliff path on the right side and kill the scarab in the bat graveyard for this fiery weapon art.

Rotten Breath: Ride to the Cathedral of Dragon Communion in southwest Caelid. Trade one Dragon Heart at the altar for your ultimate boss-melting nuke.

Phase 4: The Liurnia Skip & Roundtable
Stormveil Cliff Path Skip: Fast travel back to Stormhill Shack. Ride north under the bridge and take the hidden cliffside path on the right to bypass Stormveil Castle and enter Liurnia.

Dragon Cult Prayerbook: Ride to the Artist's Shack grace in Liurnia. Sneak up on the patrolling Leyndell Knight to the south, infect him with Rotten Breath, and run away until he dies. Loot the book.

Cipher Pata & Lightning Spear: Fast travel to the Roundtable Hold. Give the prayerbook to Brother Corhyn to buy Lightning Spear. Then, jump off the central balcony, run through the doors to the left, and grab the Cipher Pata pure-faith fist weapon off the bed before Mad Tongue Alberich can kill you.

Phase 5: The Final Pieces (Stormveil Castle)
Melt Margit: Fast travel to the Castleward Tunnel. Summon your Jellyfish, walk up to Margit, cast Rotten Breath, and run away. Hit him with Flame of Frenzy or Catch Flame if you want to speed it up.

Godslayer’s Seal & Black Flame: Proceed into Stormveil Castle to the Rampart Tower grace. Drop down into the courtyard with the exiles, find the Stonesword Key fog wall, and unlock it. Loot the chest and the prayerbook inside to claim your best-in-class early seal and your main mid-to-late game boss killer.

Would you like the quickest route to scoop up 3 or 4 early Golden Seeds and Sacred Tears to ensure you have enough FP flasks to cast all these new spells?

You said
I need a good early game spirit ash to distract bosses while i cast spells. also i need two armaments to focus smithing stones on, one somber, one regular

To keep the boss's attention away from you while you channel long spells, you need a summon with supreme survivability. Combining that with a focused upgrade path for your weapons will round out your build perfectly.

The Ultimate Distraction: Skeletal Militiaman Ashes
For a pure spellcaster, nothing beats a tank that refuses to stay dead. This ash summons two spear-wielding skeletons. When a boss reduces their health to zero, they collapse into a glowing pile of bones. As long as the boss does not hit that glowing pile with an accidental area-of-effect attack, the skeletons will resurrect with full health a few seconds later and immediately pull the boss's aggro again.

Location: Defeat the Tibia Mariner in Summonwater Village (Northeast Limgrave). This is an incredibly slow, easy boss you can safely melt with Catch Flame or Flame of Frenzy from horseback.

Your Arsenal: Upgrade Priorities
By maintaining one regular weapon and one unique weapon, you avoid bottlenecking your upgrade materials and can take advantage of both standard and somber smithing stones as you explore.

Weapon Category	Top Choice	Upgrade Material	Build Synergy	Location
Regular Armament	Morning Star	Smithing Stones	It deals strike damage (which destroys heavily armored enemies and stone miners) and has innate bleed. Equip the Sacred Blade Ash of War on it to convert its scaling entirely to Faith while adding a devastating holy projectile attack.	In a chest on a broken carriage along the main road of the Weeping Peninsula.
Somber Armament	Winged Scythe	Somber Smithing Stones	It has long reach, innate bleed, and scales beautifully with Faith right out of the box. Its unique skill, Angel's Wings, is a leaping strike that deals massive poise damage to easily stagger aggressive bosses.	In a chest inside the dark cellar of the Tombsward Ruins in the Weeping Peninsula.
Would you like a quick, zero-combat farming route to grab enough early stones to immediately upgrade your Morning Star to +3 and your Winged Scythe to +2?

You said
Hmm as for upgrade, you are forgetting that seals also need upgrades. so one seal and one weapon

You are completely right, and that is a crucial catch. Seals absolutely compete for the exact same upgrade materials as your melee weapons, and splitting your stones between two regular weapons and a regular seal will leave you severely underpowered.

To perfectly balance your economy so you are upgrading your spellcasting and your melee damage simultaneously without any overlap, here is the exact pairing you need to focus on:

The Perfect Upgrade Split
Armament	Category	Upgrade Material	Why It Fits
Godslayer's Seal	Catalyst	Regular Smithing Stones	This is the engine of your entire build. Upgrading it increases your "Incantation Scaling," which directly boosts the damage of Catch Flame, Lightning Spear, and Black Flame. Because it uses regular stones, it will never compete with your primary melee weapon.
Winged Scythe	Melee Weapon	Somber Smithing Stones	Since your seal is eating all your regular stones, you need a weapon that uses Somber stones. The Winged Scythe is undeniably the strongest early-game Faith weapon, has massive reach, applies bleed, and upgrades easily via the Somber path.
What happens to the Morning Star?
You will still use the Morning Star to kill the sleeping dragon (Greyoll) because you only need its passive bleed effect, which works perfectly even at +0. After the dragon is dead and you meet the stats for the Winged Scythe, the Morning Star goes into your inventory, and you wield the Scythe and the Seal full-time.

Would you like me to point you to the easiest spots in Limgrave to grab Somber Smithing Stones [1], [2], and [3] so you can instantly boost that Winged Scythe without fighting anything?

You said
I have the early game build complete. for mid game what items should i try to get?

You are officially out of the early game. By the time you reach Altus Plateau, Volcano Manor, and Leyndell, your stats are high enough that you need to shift your focus from "raw base damage" to synergy and multipliers.

For the mid-game, your goal is to stack buffs and grab the undisputed king of Faith weapons to carry you through the rest of the game. Keep upgrading your Godslayer's Seal—it remains the best catalyst for pure Faith until you hit about 60+ Faith.

Here is exactly what you need to hunt down next to keep your power curve completely broken:

1. The Essential Buffs (The Multipliers)
In the mid-game, casting these two spells before a boss fight will universally skyrocket your damage. They stack together, and you should never fight a boss without them active.

Golden Vow (Incantation): * What it does: Increases ALL damage you deal by 15% and reduces all damage you take by 10% for 80 seconds. It is the single best buff in the game.

How to get it: Ride through Mt. Gelmir to the Corpse-Stench Shack. It is just sitting inside on a corpse. No bosses required.

Flame, Grant Me Strength:

What it does: Increases Physical and Fire damage by an additional 20% for 30 seconds. This stacks multiplicatively with Golden Vow and makes your Catch Flame, Black Flame, and Flame of Frenzy hit like a freight train.

How to get it: Tucked behind two maneuvering flame chariots at Fort Gael in western Caelid. You can just sneak around them, grab it off the corpse, and run.

2. The Mid-Game Nuke Weapons
Your Winged Scythe is fantastic, but the mid-game offers two specialized weapons that will completely redefine your build.

The King of Faith: Blasphemous Blade

Why you want it: It is widely considered the best PvE weapon in Elden Ring. It scales heavily with Faith, deals massive fire damage, and its Ash of War (Taker's Flames) knocks enemies flat on their backs while simultaneously healing you for a percentage of your max HP.

How to get it: You must defeat Rykard, Lord of Blasphemy at Volcano Manor. He is a gimmick boss fight where you are given a special spear to kill him, meaning your actual level and build don't matter as much.

The Pure Magic Option: Coded Sword

Why you want it: We discussed this earlier! A blade made of pure holy light that ignores shields entirely and has an incredible unblockable sweeping attack. It weighs 0.0 and requires zero Strength or Dex.

How to get it: Found in Leyndell, Royal Capital on the upper floor of the fortified manor (the area that looks exactly like the Roundtable Hold).

3. The Power-Spike Talismans
Your talisman pouches should be expanding by now. Fill them with these to drastically alter your casting efficiency.

Radagon Icon:

What it does: Shortens the casting time of all spells and incantations. Essential for getting off those clutch Black Flames or Lightning Spears.

How to get it: In the Raya Lucaria Academy. From the Debate Parlor grace, run outside, hook a hard right, jump over the railing, and climb the ladder up to the balcony above the parlor.

Godfrey Icon:

What it does: Raises the attack power of charged spells and skills by 15%. This applies to a fully charged Lightning Spear, Flame of Frenzy, and Black Flame.

How to get it: Drop into the Golden Lineage Evergaol in the Altus Plateau and defeat Godefroy the Grafted (just a weaker version of Godrick).

Faithful's Canvas Talisman:

What it does: Flat 4% boost to the damage of all your offensive incantations.

How to get it: Found in the Sellia Crystal Tunnel in Caelid. It is guarded by two of those annoying Prawn Miners, but you can just sprint past them and loot it.

4. The Large-Boss Melter (Incantation)
Pest Threads: * What it does: Shoots a barrage of sticky threads. While it sounds weak, the threads deal "continuous" damage as they travel through an enemy's hitbox. If you use this on massive mid/late-game bosses (like Dragons, Astel, or the Elden Beast) at point-blank range, the threads will hit them dozens of times per cast, deleting their health bars faster than almost anything else in the game.

How to get it: Progress Gowry's questline in Caelid (giving him the Unalloyed Gold Needle) and he will sell it to you.

Would you like me to map out the exact, boss-free "Dectus Medallion Skip" route to reach the Altus Plateau and Volcano Manor immediately, so you can grab Golden Vow and start the Blasphemous Blade questline right now?

You said
What items should i look for in late game for this pure faith build?

Welcome to the endgame. When you reach the Mountaintops of the Giants, Crumbling Farum Azula, and the Haligtree, enemies hit incredibly hard and have massive health pools. Your goal here is reaching 70 to 80 Faith, maximizing your scaling, and grabbing the absolute most destructive area-of-effect (AoE) nukes in the game.

Here is your late-game shopping list to maintain your status as an overpowered god:

1. The Final Catalyst: Erdtree Seal
Your Godslayer’s Seal is amazing, but it eventually hits a soft cap. Once your Faith stat crosses 69, the Erdtree Seal mathematically out-scales every other seal in the game for pure Faith casting.

Why it works: It has "S" scaling in Faith and no secondary stat requirements. At 80 Faith, its Incantation Scaling is unmatched, making all your spells hit for maximum base damage.

How to get it: It's actually found in Volcano Manor near the Prison Town Church grace. You can grab it in the mid-game, but you shouldn't switch to it until your Faith approaches 70.

2. The Boss One-Shot: Ancient Dragons' Lightning Strike
If Rotten Breath and Pest Threads were your early/mid-game boss killers, this is your endgame delete button. It is arguably the highest DPS spell in the entire game against large targets.

Why it works: You summon a massive storm of red lightning that strikes the ground repeatedly and spreads outward. Against massive late-game bosses (like Placidusax, the Fire Giant, or Elden Beast), multiple lightning bolts will hit their massive hitboxes simultaneously. A fully charged cast with the right buffs can literally one-shot endgame bosses.

How to get it: Found in the Crumbling Farum Azula. You need to find the Ancient Dragon Prayerbook and give it to Miriel (the Turtle Pope) or Corhyn.

3. The AoE Nuke: Giant's Flame Take Thee
Lightning Spear is great for quick pokes, but when you need to clear a room or knock heavy enemies flat on their backs, you need this.

Why it works: It hurls a massive fireball that explodes on impact. It has incredible range, huge splash damage, and deals massive poise damage. It is the ultimate heavy-artillery spell.

How to get it: Found in the Mountaintops of the Giants at the Guardians' Garrison. Defeat Chief Guardian Arghanthy to get the Giant's Prayerbook.

4. The Talisman Upgrades
You need to swap out your mid-game talismans for their superior endgame versions.

Flock’s Canvas Talisman: This is the direct upgrade to your Faithful's Canvas Talisman. It boosts all incantation damage by a massive 8%.

How to get it: You must complete Millicent’s questline (or kill her early, though completing it is better) and then kill Gowry in his shack in Caelid to get it.

Dragoncrest Greatshield Talisman: Late-game enemies will easily two-shot you. This talisman enormously reduces physical damage taken by 20%, ensuring you survive long enough to cast your nukes.

How to get it: Found in a chest in Elphael, Brace of the Haligtree, guarded by several Pests.

Fire / Lightning Scorpion Charms: Depending on whether you are spamming Giant's Flame or Ancient Dragons' Lightning Strike, equip the corresponding charm to boost that elemental damage by another 12% (at the cost of taking slightly more physical damage).

5. The Meme Weapon That Kills Gods: Envoy's Long Horn
If you are already using the Blasphemous Blade, you can easily use it to beat the game. However, if you want a purely Faith-focused alternative that absolutely wrecks large endgame bosses, you want the giant golden saxophone.

Why it works: The Ash of War, Bubble Shower, blows a massive cloud of holy bubbles that track the target. Against large bosses, every single bubble hits, resulting in staggering amounts of Holy damage and rapid poise breaks.

How to get it: It is a rare drop from the Large Oracle Envoys (the big marshmallow snowmen holding large horns) in Leyndell, Royal Capital or the Haligtree.

6. The Final Boss Counter: Lord's Divine Fortification
The final two bosses of the game deal almost exclusively Holy damage.

Why you need it: Casting this incantation drastically reduces Holy damage taken by 60% for 70 seconds. It turns the final, most frustrating fights in the game into an absolute joke because their massive, flashy attacks will only chip away at your health.

How to get it: Given to you by Gideon Ofnir at the Roundtable Hold after you defeat Malenia, or purchased from the Twin Maiden Husks if Gideon has left.

How about the DLC shadow of the erdtree?

Shadow of the Erdtree is essentially a giant love letter to Faith builds. From Software added so many incredibly powerful holy, fire, and lightning tools that Faith is widely considered one of the strongest ways to tackle the DLC's brutal difficulty spikes.

Since you are running a pure Faith caster, your 80 Faith stat is going to feast. Here is the ultimate shopping list to upgrade your build once you step into the Realm of Shadow.

1. The Direct Spell Upgrades (The New Nukes)
You can permanently retire your base-game Lightning Spear and Pest Threads. The DLC gives you direct, overpowered upgrades to both.

Knight's Lightning Spear:

Why it’s broken: It throws a primary lightning spear, but simultaneously summons a volley of smaller spears that strike the target slightly after. It deals vastly more damage and poise damage than the standard version, and if an enemy dodges the first spear, the delayed secondary spears will usually catch them at the end of their roll.

How to get it: Found in the Scorpion River Catacombs.

Pest-Thread Spears:

Why it’s broken: The ultimate large-boss deleter just got bigger. Instead of a flurry of small threads, you launch two massive, piercing stingers. Because of how they travel through hitboxes, casting this point-blank at massive DLC bosses (like Bayle or the Scadutree Avatar) will shred their health bars in seconds.

How to get it: Found in the Ancient Ruins of Rauh.

Fire Serpent:

Why it’s broken: It summons a ribbon of flame that actively tracks the enemy with terrifying accuracy. It is incredibly cheap to cast, highly spammable, and perfect for the extremely fast, agile enemies in the DLC that easily dodge your standard fireballs.

How to get it: Found in the Shadow Keep (Specimen Storehouse).

2. The God-Tier DLC Weapons
The DLC introduces weapons that scale so absurdly well with Faith that they rival or even surpass the Blasphemous Blade.

The Holy Laser: Euporia (Twinblade)

Why you want it: Following a post-launch patch, Euporia is arguably the highest DPS Faith weapon in the entire game. It deals pure physical and holy damage. As you hit enemies, the weapon begins to glow. Once fully charged, using the Ash of War unleashes a massive, sustained Holy laser beam that completely melts bosses.

How to get it: Found in the final legacy dungeon, Enir-Ilim, via a hidden jumping puzzle.

The Colossal Caster: Fire Knight's Greatsword

Why you want it: Even though it’s a massive sword, it is a pure Faith weapon in disguise. If you apply the Flame Art affinity to it, it gains tremendous Faith scaling. It has a unique, faster light-attack moveset, and putting the DLC's Flame Skewer or Flame Spear Ash of War on it gives you devastating hyper-armor attacks.

How to get it: Farmed from the tall Fire Knights wielding it in the Shadow Keep.

The Guard-Counter King: Black Steel Greathammer

Why you want it: This hammer has innate Holy damage built into it. If you put the Sacred affinity on it, the Holy scaling absolutely skyrockets. More importantly, successfully pulling off a guard counter with this weapon creates an explosive Holy AoE on the ground, making it an absolute stagger machine.

How to get it: Dropped by the Black Knight in the Church of Consolation.

3. The Ultimate Support Tools
The Sword of Light (Buff Weapon):

Why you need it: You don't even need to upgrade this or use it to hit things. You just keep it in your off-hand. Using its weapon art casts a buff that increases all Holy damage by 20% for 60 seconds. This stacks with Golden Vow. If you cast this and then swap back to your Erdtree Seal, your Multilayered Rings of Light and Euporia laser will do mind-bending damage.

How to get it: You must find the Stone-Sheathed Sword and convert it at an altar (like the one in the Ruins of Unte).

Heal From Afar:

Why you need it: Exactly what it sounds like. It shoots a healing projectile. While meant for co-op, you can just aim it at the ground at your own feet to heal yourself. It casts significantly faster than Lord's Heal, making it highly viable during aggressive boss fights.

If you are walking into the DLC with 80 Faith, the Erdtree Seal, and the Blasphemous Blade, your priority should be sprinting to the Scorpion River Catacombs to grab Knight's Lightning Spear. It completely changes the ranged game.

What about spirit ashes that are well compatible with spellcaster builds?

As a pure spellcaster, your biggest enemy in the mid-to-late game and the DLC is getting your long casting animations interrupted. You no longer need your Spirit Ash to do the damage for you; you just need a massive, immovable slab of meat to stand between you and the boss.

While the Jellyfish and Skeletons were great early on, here are the absolute best endgame and DLC Spirit Ashes tailored specifically for keeping a spellcaster safe:

1. The Brick Wall: Greatshield Soldier Ashes (Base Game)
If you want to pin a boss into a corner so you can mindlessly spam Giant's Flame or Ancient Dragons' Lightning Strike, this is the best summon in the base game.

Why it works for casters: It summons five soldiers wielding massive tower shields. They surround the boss, throw ghostflame pots to draw aggro, and constantly block. Because there are five of them, they completely scramble the boss's AI and physically trap them in place.

How to get it: Found in Nokron, Eternal City. You can grab them in the graveyard area right after defeating the Mimic Tear boss.

2. The Immortal DLC Tank: Taylew the Golem Smith (DLC)
This is the undisputed king of tanking in Shadow of the Erdtree, and he has a broken synergy specifically with Faith builds.

Why it works for casters: Taylew is a massive stone golem with hyper-armor and an absurdly high physical defense pool. Because you are a Faith build, you can stand safely in the back of the arena and shoot him with your new Heal From Afar incantation. If you keep topping up his health, Taylew can literally tank every single major DLC boss indefinitely while you chip away with spells.

How to get it: Found by completing Taylew's Ruined Forge, located north of the Ancient Ruins Base grace in the DLC.

3. The Aggressive Debuffer: Dung Eater Puppet (Base Game)
If you want a tank that also makes your spells hit harder, you have to do some morally questionable things to get this puppet.

Why it works for casters: He is incredibly aggressive and has an enormous health pool. More importantly, his special attack (the Sword of Milos shriek) applies a debuff to the boss that reduces all of their damage negations. This means your holy, fire, and lightning spells will hit for noticeably more damage while he holds the boss's attention.

How to get it: You must progress Preceptor Seluvis's questline and give Seluvis's Potion to the Dung Eater in the Subterranean Shunning-Grounds, rather than giving it to Nepheli.

4. The Agile Assassin: Black Knife Tiche (Base Game)
If a boss does massive area-of-effect (AoE) attacks that instantly wipe out tanky summons like the Greatshield Soldiers, Tiche is your backup plan.

Why it works for casters: Instead of blocking, Tiche survives by dodging. She constantly flips around the arena, making her very hard for bosses to hit. Additionally, she spams a projectile of Destined Death that instantly burns away 10% of a boss's maximum HP and continues to drain their health over time. She melts health bars while you charge up your heavy artillery.

How to get it: You must defeat Alecto, Black Knife Ringleader in the Ringleader's Evergaol (located on the Moonlight Altar plateau, which requires progressing Ranni's questline).

A Quick Note on the Mimic Tear
The Mimic Tear is normally the best summon in the game, but for a pure caster, it can actually be terrible. If your Mimic only has a seal equipped, it will just stand in the back casting spells alongside you, leaving no one to actually tank the boss.

The Caster Mimic Cheese: Before you walk through the boss fog, equip the Shabriri's Woe talisman (which constantly draws enemy aggro) and a massive heavy shield. Summon your Mimic. As soon as the Mimic spawns, take Shabriri's Woe and the shield off your character and equip your spellcasting gear. Your Mimic will now permanently hold the boss's attention while you nuke from afar.
