# Cost Estimate for Elden Ring Checklists Project

To estimate the server costs for adding a domain name, database, and user authentication to your Elden Ring Checklists project, here's a rough estimate based on common cloud services. Keep in mind that actual costs may vary depending on your specific requirements and chosen providers.

## Domain Name
- **Cost**: $10 - $20 per year
- This is a fixed cost and doesn't require any server resources.

## Database
Assuming you'll use a managed database service like MongoDB Atlas or Amazon DynamoDB:
- **Cost**: $0 - $57 per month
- Free tier options are available for low traffic sites
- Paid tiers start around $57/month for more resources and features

## User Authentication
Using a service like Auth0 or Firebase Authentication:
- **Cost**: $0 - $23 per month
- Free tier options available for up to 7,000 active users/month
- Paid tiers start around $23/month for more users and features

## Total Estimated Cost
- **Minimum** (using free tiers): $10 - $20 per year (domain name only)
- **Maximum** (paid tiers): $970 - $980 per year ($80/month + domain name)

These estimates assume modest usage. Costs could increase with higher traffic or more demanding requirements. It's best to start with free tiers where possible and scale up as needed.
