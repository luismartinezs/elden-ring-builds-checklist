# Style Review Report

Based on a review of configuration files (`prettier.config.cjs`, `.eslintrc.cjs`, `tailwind.config.ts`) and general best practices:

1.  **Expand Tailwind Theme:** The current `tailwind.config.ts` only defines `primary` and `secondary` colors.
    *   **Suggestion:** Significantly expand the `theme.extend` section. Define a broader palette of semantic colors (e.g., `brand`, `accent`, `neutral`, `success`, `warning`, `error` variations). Define consistent scales for spacing, typography (font sizes, line heights), border radii, and potentially other properties like box shadows.
    *   **Benefit:** This promotes consistency across the application, makes refactoring styles easier (change in one place), and improves adherence to a design system, even if implicit initially.

2.  **Minimize Global Styles:** Global styles should be used sparingly.
    *   **Suggestion:** Limit global styles to essential resets (Tailwind's `preflight` handles most), base body/font styles, and CSS variable definitions if used. Avoid defining component-specific styles globally. Review `src/styles/globals.css` if it exists.
    *   **Benefit:** Reduces unexpected style conflicts and makes component styling more predictable and encapsulated.

3.  **Enforce Utility-First Approach:** Tailwind's strength lies in its utility classes.
    *   **Suggestion:** Strongly prefer Tailwind utility classes over inline styles (`style={{ ... }}`) or custom CSS classes in separate files (unless necessary for complex animations or unsupported features). Use libraries like `clsx` or `tailwind-merge` for conditional class application.
    *   **Benefit:** Keeps styling colocated with the markup, leverages Tailwind's optimized CSS output, and improves maintainability.

4.  **Review ESLint Stylistic Rules:** The `.eslintrc.cjs` disables `@typescript-eslint/array-type` and `@typescript-eslint/consistent-type-definitions`.
    *   **Suggestion:** Revisit the reasons for disabling these rules. While sometimes necessary, enforcing consistent type definitions (`type` vs `interface`) and array types (`T[]` vs `Array<T>`) can improve code readability and consistency.
    *   **Benefit:** Enhances code uniformity and potentially catches minor inconsistencies.

5.  **Leverage CSS Variables (Optional but Recommended):**
    *   **Suggestion:** Define core theme values (especially colors) as CSS variables in `globals.css` (or a dedicated theme file) and reference them in `tailwind.config.ts`.
    *   **Benefit:** Simplifies potential future features like dynamic theme switching (e.g., light/dark mode) and provides a centralized place for core design tokens.

6.  **Consider a UI Component Library:** As the application grows, encapsulate common UI patterns.
    *   **Suggestion:** Create reusable components for elements like buttons, inputs, cards, modals, etc., within a dedicated directory (e.g., `src/components/ui`). Ensure these components consistently use the defined Tailwind theme and follow accessibility best practices.
    *   **Benefit:** Improves code reuse, ensures UI consistency, simplifies development, and makes testing easier.
