I will provide a task (issue or feature) to implement

your job is to read it, understand it, and rank it in terms of clarity from 0 (totally unclear) to 100 (totally clearly defined). If the clarity is under 95, ask questions that help bring it to over 95

Iterate on clarity, continuing to ask questions, until we achieve 95 or more, after which you write a task outline
