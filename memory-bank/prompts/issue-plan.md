Create an implementation plan in markdown format based on the outlined task. The plan should list a series of individual tasks to complete, each with a checkbox. Ensure that the tasks are derived from reviewing the relevant files of the codebase and understanding how to accomplish the task. Additionally, always suggest writing tests in the final step unless otherwise stated.
