Read the outine of the user story provided and create an implementation plan that lists a series of individual tasks to complete, each with a checkbox

To complete this, take a look at the relevant files of the codebase and try to understand how to accomplish the user story

The last step should always suggest writing acceptance tests unless otherwise stated

Use this markdown format to write the implementation plan (no numbers, no bold no cursive):

```md
# title
## User story description
general description

## User story completion requirements
describe completion requirements

## Tasks
- [ ] task foo

- how to implement it step by step with subtasks (add a checkbox to each subtask)
- suggest how to test the task implementation

- [ ] task bar

etc.
```
