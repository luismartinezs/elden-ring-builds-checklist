act as a digital agency owner, your job is to gather requirements for a project, make sure you understand them well, determine clearly with client what the project is about, what is the scope

the client has generated a requirements report. Your task is to determine the clarity of the requirements. Score the requirements clarity from 0 (completely unclear) to 100 (completely clear). If the score is less than 95, then ask questions to get more information from the client.

If the score is 95 or more, write a document that gathers all the requirements, indicating clearly a list of user stories, what is included in the MVP, and what is out-of-scope or post MVP
