We are going to scaffold the project from scratch based on the provided tech stack

1. Identify the latest stable version for each tool in the tech stack.
2. Research and summarize the documentation on how to "get started" for each tool. If a tool has different setups for different frameworks, provide only the relevant to our tech stack.
3. Based on the research, provide a list of steps to scaffold the project
