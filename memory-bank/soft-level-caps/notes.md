how to present this info so that it is useful? (I would use it)

what problems does it solve? what is the problem?

- what are the stat soft caps for each?
- my stats are X, Y, Z, what should I level next? the widget proposes what stat to level next based on some simple heuristic. i can also say "level INT to 40" and things like this, basically a list

Example:
- current stats = X,Y,Z
- next steps
  - level str to 20
  - level vgr to 40
  - etc

use simple heuristics, do not overdo it (or I could go full math and calculate "gains") but this is post MVP


- stat selector for current profile
  - + and -
  - numeric input
- dynamically adjust next thing to level
- other user input needed (none are required):
  - archetype: caster / melee / ... (mnd, end)
  - FP for max upgraded flask (mnd)
  - 2 handing (str)
  - primary stat
  - secondary stat
  - requirements (str/dex/int/fai/arc values)

page also shows static section with soft caps for each stat
- for each stat show a "bar" from 0 to 99 (just do it)
